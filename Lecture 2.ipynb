    "- Experiment with $n$ identical trials.\n",

    "We aim to find the expected value $E[Y]$.\n",

    "#### Step 1: Definition of Expected Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability:\n",
    "$E[Y] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i \\cdot P(Y_i = y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Substitute Joint Probability Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the joint probability distribution:\n",
    "$P(Y_1 = y_1, Y_2 = y_2, ..., Y_k = y_k) = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!...y_k!} \\cdot p_1^{y_1} \\cdot p_2^{y_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{y_k}$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Rearrange Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y] = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!...y_k!} \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{y_1} y_1 \\cdot p_1\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{y_2} y_2 \\cdot p_2\\right) \\cdot ... \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{y_k} y_k \\cdot p_k\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Recognize Individual Sums as Expected Values of Binomial Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Substitute Expected Values\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y] = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!...y_k!} \\cdot (n \\cdot p_1) \\cdot (n \\cdot p_2) \\cdot ... \\cdot (n \\cdot p_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Simplify\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y] = n \\cdot (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k)$\n",
